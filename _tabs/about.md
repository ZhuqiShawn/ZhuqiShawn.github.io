Greeting, I am so glad you can find me here. I am Zhuqi, a software developer, a beat-boxer, and I also call myself a "second-hand" photographer. I occasionally post some articles or notes here for myself and someone who might be interested. In addition to coding, I also make short videos teaching Python on Bilibili. If you want to know me more, download my [CV](https://github.com/ZhuqiShawn/ZhuqiShawn.github.io/raw/main/assets/ZHUQI_CV.pdf), or contact me at [zqxiao.shawn@gmail.com](mailto:zqxiao.shawn@gmail.com).
