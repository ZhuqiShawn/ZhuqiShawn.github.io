Greeting, I am so glad you can find me here. I am Zhuqi, a master's student at [Chalmers University of Technology](https://www.chalmers.se/en/Pages/default.aspx), studying Data Science and AI. I am a programmer, a beat-boxer, and I also call myself a "second-hand" photographer. I occasionally post some articles or notes here for myself and someone who might be interested. If you want to know me more, download my [CV](), contact me at [zqxiao.shawn@gmail.com](zqxiao.shawn@gmail.com), or walking around Gothenburg, you might see me. 

You can also find me [![`[LinkedIn]`](https://img.shields.io/badge/LinkedIn-blue?style=flat&logo=linkedin&labelColor=blue)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zhuqi-xiao-6607231b9/)
